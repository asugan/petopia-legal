    <h1>Privacy Policy - Shadow Work Prompts & Journal</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 19, 2026<br />
      <strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 19, 2026
    </p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      Welcome to Shadow Work Prompts & Journal. We deeply respect the personal
      and sensitive nature of journaling. This Privacy Policy explains our
      commitment to your privacy and how data is handled when you use our mobile
      application ("App").
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Our Privacy Philosophy:</strong> What you write in your journal is
      yours alone. We have designed this app with a "local-first" approach,
      meaning your entries stay on your device.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information You Provide (Local Data)</h2>

    <p>
      The following information is created by you and
      <strong>stored locally on your device</strong>. We do not transmit this
      data to our servers, and we cannot read or access it:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Journal Entries:</strong> Text you write in response to prompts.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Voice Notes:</strong> Audio recordings you make within the app.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mood Data:</strong> Your selected daily moods and reflections.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>App Preferences:</strong> Custom reminder times, language
        preferences, and themes.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <em
        >Note: If you delete the app without utilizing your device's cloud
        backup (e.g., iCloud or Google Drive), your journal entries will be
        permanently lost.</em
      >
    </p>

    <h2>3. Information Collected Automatically</h2>

    <p>
      To keep the app running smoothly and manage premium features, we collect
      limited non-personal data:
    </p>

    <p><strong>Device and Diagnostic Data:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Device type, operating system version, and generic location (e.g.,
        country).
      </li>
      <li>
        Crash logs and performance metrics (via Expo Updates) to help us fix
        bugs.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Subscription Data:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you purchase a premium subscription or prompt pack, our third-party
        provider (RevenueCat) processes purchase information and anonymous
        device identifiers to unlock your features. We do not process or store
        your credit card information.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>

    <p>
      We use trusted third-party services specifically for app functionality:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>RevenueCat:</strong> Used for managing in-app purchases and
        subscriptions securely.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Expo:</strong> Used for delivering over-the-air updates and
        collecting anonymous crash reports to improve stability.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Apple / Google:</strong> For processing payments and handling
        your device's native cloud backups (if you have them enabled).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>

    <p>
      Because your sensitive data (journals, voice notes) resides on your
      device, the security of this data relies on your device's security
      measures. We strongly recommend:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Using a strong passcode or biometric lock (Face ID/Touch ID) on your
        phone.
      </li>
      <li>Keeping your operating system up to date.</li>
      <li>Being mindful of who has physical access to your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Exporting Your Data</h2>

    <p>
      The App provides features to export your journal entries (e.g., as PDF
      files). Once you export and save or share these files outside the App,
      they are no longer protected by the App's environment. Please handle your
      exported data securely.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>

    <p>
      Shadow Work Prompts & Journal is intended for individuals aged 13 and
      older. Due to the psychological nature of shadow work, we strongly advise
      parental guidance for younger teenagers. We do not knowingly collect any
      personal data from children under 13.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. When we make significant
      changes, we will notify you by updating the date at the top of this policy
      and, if necessary, providing a notice within the app.
    </p>

    <h2>Apple App Store & Google Play Data Safety Summary</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Data linked to you:</strong> Subscription status and purchase
        history (handled securely via Apple/Google and RevenueCat).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Data not linked to you:</strong> Anonymous diagnostics (crash
        logs, performance data) used strictly to keep the app reliable.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>User Content (Journals/Audio):</strong> 100% stored on your
        device. We do not collect, read, or share your entries.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tracking:</strong> We do not track you across other apps or
        websites for advertising purposes.
      </li>
    </ul>
